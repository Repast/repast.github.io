		Repast Simphony {{ site.simphony_version }}, released on 
		<i>{{ site.simphony_release_date }}</i>, is a tightly integrated, 
		richly interactive, cross platform Java-based modeling system that runs 
		under Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux. It supports the 
		development of extremely flexible models of interacting agents for use 
		on workstations and computing clusters. 
		
		<b>Repast Simphony is compatible with Java 8. Java 9 is not supported.</b>

		<br><br>Repast Simphony models can be developed in several different forms 
		including the <a href="./images/relogo_development.png"> ReLogo</a> dialect
		of Logo, point-and-click <a href="./images/statechart2.png">statecharts</a>,
		<a href="http://groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a>, or <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/">Java</a>, all of
		which can be fluidly interleaved.<br><br>

		Repast Simphony has been successfully used in many application domains including
		social science,	consumer products, supply chains, hydrogen infrastructures,
		manufacturing, epidemiology, biomedical systems modeling, and ancient 
		pedestrian traffic to name a few.  Please see the <a href="./papers.html">Papers</a>
		section for a comprehensive review.
