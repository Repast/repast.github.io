Adding Agent Adaptation Using Genetic Algorithms
------------------------------------------------

Repast Simphony (Repast S) uses the Java Genetic Algorithms Package (JGAP)
(http://jgap.sourceforge.net/) to implement genetic algorithms. JGAP can be used directly within agents
or the Repast S genetic algorithms (GA) wrapper can be used. Directly using JGAP provides maximum
flexibility but requires more complex programming. The Repast S GA wrapper simplifies the use of JGAP
while preserving most options. It is recommended that Repast S users start with the Repast S wrapper
and, only if needed, eventually move to directly use of JGAP. The Repast S regression wrapper is
consistent with direct use of JGAP so this should relatively straightforward. Obviously, as with all machine
learning tools, it is important to make sure that genetic algorithms, in general, and the chosen
formulation, in particular, are appropriate for your application.

TIP: Documentation on how to use JGAP directly can be found on their web site, http://jgap.sourceforge.net/ In particular, please see the following page: http://jgap.sourceforge.net/doc/tutorial.html

To use the Repast S GA wrapper in the visual editor simply follow these steps:
1.) Add a property of type "Genetic Algorithm" to an agent. "evaluate" is the name of the fitness function
that needs to be created as described in step two. "populationSize" is the count of the members in the GA
population. The "Gene" array gives the set of genes, either "IntegerGene" or "DoubleGene," to be used.
The parameters to the constructors (e.g., "min1" and "max1") are the optional lower and upper bounds
for that gene. The template is as follows:
new RepastGA(this, "evaluate", populationSize, new Gene[]{ new IntegerGene(min1, max1) new
DoubleGene(min2, max2)})
2.) Add a behavior that takes a double precision array (i.e., "double[]"), returns an positive integer
result, and that uses the fitness function name given above (e.g., "evaluate"). The double array is the
current population member to be evaluated. The genes are in the same order as the template given in
step one. Higher fitness result values mean greater fitness levels. The exact range does not matter as
long as the numbers are positive.
3.) Using the Wizard dialog, chose "Advanced Adaptation," "Use a Genetic Algorithm," "Get the Best
Solution from a Genetic Algorithm," and then fill in the form to get a solution. The returned double array
is the current best solution. The genes are in the same order as the template given in step one.
4.) If the population needs to be reset, perhaps due to a plateau, using the Wizard dialog, chose
"Advanced Adaptation," "Use a Genetic Algorithm," "Reset the Population of a Genetic Algorithm," and
then fill in the form.
To use the Repast S GA wrapper in the Java or Groovy simply follow these steps:
1.) Add an agent class field of type RepastGA and create an instance following this template:
new RepastGA(this, "evaluate", populationSize, new Gene[]{ new IntegerGene(min1, max1) new DoubleGene(min2, max2)})
"evaluate" is the name of the fitness function that needs to be created as described in step two.
"populationSize" is the count of the members in the GA population. The "Gene" array gives the set of
genes, either "IntegerGene" or "DoubleGene," to be used. The parameters to the constructors (e.g.,
"min1" and "max1") are the optional lower and upper bounds for that gene.
2.) Add a class method behavior that takes a double precision array (i.e., "double[]"), returns an positive
integer result, and that uses the fitness function name given above (e.g., "evaluate"). The double array is
the current population member to be evaluated. The genes are in the same order as the template given
in step one. Higher fitness result values mean greater fitness levels. The exact range does not matter as
long as the numbers are positive. For higher performance, advanced users can implement
org.jgap.FitnessFunction in place of just the creating the simple "int evaluate(double[])" method.
3.) Use the following method template to get a solution:
double[] solution = model.getBestSolution(cycles)
"cycles" is the number of evolutionary steps to use to compute the requested solution. The returned
double array is the current best solution. The genes are in the same order as the template given in step
one.
4.) If the population needs to be reset, use the following method template:
model.reset()

Adding Agent Adaptation Using Neural Networks
---------------------------------------------

Repast Simphony (Repast S) uses the Java Object Oriented Neural Engine (Joone)
(http://www.jooneworld.com/) library to implement neural networks. Joone can be used directly within
agents or the Repast S neural network wrapper can be used. Directly using Joone provides maximum
flexibility but requires more complex programming. The Repast S wrapper simplifies the use of Joone
while preserving most options. It is recommended that Repast S users start with the Repast S wrapper
and, only if needed, eventually move to directly use of Joone. The Repast S wrapper is consistent with
direct use of Joone so this should relatively straightforward. Obviously, as with all machine learning tools,
it is important to make sure that neural networks, in general, and the chosen network design, in
particular, are appropriate for your application.
Documentation on how to use Joone directly can be found on their web site, http://www.jooneworld.com/
To use the Repast S neural network wrapper in the visual editor simply follow these steps:
1.) Add a property of type "Linear Neural Network," "Logistic Neural Network," or "Softmax Neural
Network" to an agent to produce the corresponding type of neural network. Replace the integer (i.e., int)
array elements with a description of the layers for your application. The first number in the array is the
count of input neurons, the last number is the count of output neurons, and the intermediate numbers
are the interstitial layers. You can have as many interstitial layers as you would like (i.e., zero or more).
2.) Using the Wizard dialog, chose "Advanced Adaptation," "Use a Neural Network," "Train a Neural
Network Model," and then fill in the form to store data for fitting. The input data array is indexed by the
number of training examples and the number of input neurons. The output data array is indexed by the
number of training examples and the number of output neurons.
3.) Using the Wizard dialog, chose "Advanced Adaptation," "Use a Neural Network," "Forecast from a
Neural Network," and then fill in the form to get a forecast. The input data array is indexed by the
number of input neurons. The output data array is indexed by the number of output neurons.
To use the Repast S regression wrapper in the Java or Groovy simply follow these steps:
1.) Add an agent class field of type NeuralNet and create an linear, logistic, or softmax instance as
follows:
JooneTools.create_standard(new int[]{inputNeurons intermediateLayer1 intermediateLayer2
intermediateLayerN outputNeurons}, JooneTools.LINEAR)).
JooneTools.create_standard(new int[]{inputNeurons intermediateLayer1 intermediateLayer2
intermediateLayerN outputNeurons}, JooneTools.LOGISTIC)).
JooneTools.create_standard(new int[]{inputNeurons intermediateLayer1 intermediateLayer2
intermediateLayerN outputNeurons}, JooneTools. SOFTMAX)).
2.) Use the following method to store data for fitting where "model" is the new field name: 
JooneTools.train(model, inputDataArray, targetOutputDataArray, epochs, convergenceLimit, 0, null);
The input data array is indexed by the number of training examples and the number of input neurons.
The output data array is indexed by the number of training examples and the number of output neurons.
The model will be trained until "epochs" cycles are completed or the "convergenceLimit" of root mean
square error is achieved, whichever comes first.
3.) Use the following method to get a forecast where "model" is the new field name:
double outputData[] = JooneTools.interrogate(model, inputData)
The input data array is indexed by the number of input neurons. The output data array is indexed by the
number of output neurons.
