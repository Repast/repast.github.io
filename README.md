Repast github pages repository

This is the repast website github repository. The website is automatically updated from the repository after a short delay. 
We use the jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com) template engine for layout. Github pages will run jekyll on the repository's
contents after a repository update.

You can run jekyll locally to view and debug any layout / template related updates, but you can also view the html as is
in a browser, although it won't include any styling or formatting. That should, however, be enough to view and debug 
simple edits.
