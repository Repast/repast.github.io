    <p>This demo introduces a new, fundamental concept in Repast HPC: the <em>projection</em>. A projection is a way of structuring agent relationships. In Demo 01, we collected agents in a 'context' and allowed them to interact through random selection. This is only one way to structure agent relationships, and to determine which agent will interact with which other agents. Projections offer a way to determine the pattern of agent interactions more carefully. We will see that there are two different kinds of projections: one is spatial, in which agents move about and their relationships are structure through a logic of physical proximity; the other, which will be our focus in this demo, is via a network, in which the connections from each agent to any other agent are made explicitly.</p>
    <p>The demo here will show how a network projection can be created, how links among agents can be created and used, how the links act when agents move from process to process, and how the links can be destroyed.</p>
