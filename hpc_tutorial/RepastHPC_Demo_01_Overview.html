    <h2>Demo_01: Agents on multiple processes</h2>
    <p>Demo_01 Presents a Repast HPC model that creates agents and shares them across processes. The initial sections of the demo are devoted to explaining the fuller structure of code that defines agents, the model, and the supporting objects that allow agents to be exchanged. A basic agent is introduced, and a basic simulation crafted to allow agents to interact. The key Repast HPC features demonstrated are: exchange of agent information across processes via agent requests; movement of agents from one process to another; cancellation of agent requests; random number initialization; and random sampling of agents.<p>
