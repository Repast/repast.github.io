<p>Now that our agents are positioned in space, it's reasonable to ask them to move around. This requires the following changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a 'move' method in the agent class</li>
  <li>Create a method in the model class to call the move method</li>
  <li>Schedule the method in the model class</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the move method in the agent class, we modify Agent.h:</p>
<div class="code"><code><pre>
    /* Actions */
    bool cooperate();                                                 // Will indicate whether the agent cooperates or not; probability determined by = c / total
    void play(repast::SharedContext&lt;RepastHPCDemoAgent&gt;* context);    // Choose three other agents from the given context and see if they cooperate or not
    <b class="code">void move(repast::SharedDiscreteSpace&lt;RepastHPCDemoAgent, repast::WrapAroundBorders, repast::SimpleAdder&lt;RepastHPCDemoAgent&gt; &gt;* space);</b>
</pre></code></div>

<p>And Agent.cpp:</p>
<div class="code"><code><pre>
<b class="code">void RepastHPCDemoAgent::move(repast::SharedDiscreteSpace<RepastHPCDemoAgent, repast::WrapAroundBorders, repast::SimpleAdder<RepastHPCDemoAgent> >* space){

    std::vector<int> agentLoc;
    space->getLocation(id_, agentLoc);
    std::vector<int> agentNewLoc;
    agentNewLoc.push_back(agentLoc[0] + (id_.id() < 7 ? -1 : 1));
    agentNewLoc.push_back(agentLoc[1] + (id_.id() > 3 ? -1 : 1));
    space->moveTo(id_,agentNewLoc);
    
}</b>
</pre></code></div>


<p>Notice that the agent in this case must ask the space for its location. We could endow the agent with a record of its x,y coordinates, and in many cases this is perfectly fine. But we omit it here because it helps make clear that the projection, not the agent, is what determines the agent's relationship with other agents in that space.</p>
<p>We add a few lines to determine a new location; in this case we allow some agents (based on ID number) to move by either increasing or decreasing their x and y coordinates. We then use the 'moveTo' method to tell the space to move the agent to the new location.</p>
<p>This requires the following changes in the Model.cpp code. We will not add a special method to the model; we will instead simple add to the 'doSomething' method:</p>


<div class="code"><code><pre>
void RepastHPCDemoModel::doSomething(){
	int whichRank = 0;
	if(repast::RepastProcess::instance()-&gt;rank() == whichRank) std::cout &lt;&lt; " TICK " &lt;&lt; repast::RepastProcess::instance()-&gt;getScheduleRunner().currentTick() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

	if(repast::RepastProcess::instance()-&gt;rank() == whichRank){
		std::cout &lt;&lt; "LOCAL AGENTS:" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
		for(int r = 0; r &lt; 4; r++){
			for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
				repast::AgentId toDisplay(i, r, 0);
				RepastHPCDemoAgent* agent = context.getAgent(toDisplay);
				if((agent != 0) && (agent-&gt;getId().currentRank() == whichRank)){
                    std::vector&lt;int&gt; agentLoc;
                    discreteSpace-&gt;getLocation(agent-&gt;getId(), agentLoc);
                    repast::Point&lt;int&gt; agentLocation(agentLoc);
                    std::cout &lt;&lt; agent-&gt;getId() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; agent-&gt;getC() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; agent-&gt;getTotal() &lt;&lt; " AT " &lt;&lt; agentLocation &lt;&lt; std::endl;
                }
			}
		}
		
		std::cout &lt;&lt; "NON LOCAL AGENTS:" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
		for(int r = 0; r &lt; 4; r++){
			for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){
				repast::AgentId toDisplay(i, r, 0);
				RepastHPCDemoAgent* agent = context.getAgent(toDisplay);
				if((agent != 0) && (agent-&gt;getId().currentRank() != whichRank)){
                    std::vector&lt;int&gt; agentLoc;
                    discreteSpace-&gt;getLocation(agent-&gt;getId(), agentLoc);
                    repast::Point&lt;int&gt; agentLocation(agentLoc);
                    std::cout &lt;&lt; agent-&gt;getId() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; agent-&gt;getC() &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; agent-&gt;getTotal() &lt;&lt; " AT " &lt;&lt; agentLocation &lt;&lt; std::endl;
                }
			}
		}
	}

	
	std::vector&lt;RepastHPCDemoAgent*&gt; agents;
	context.selectAgents(repast::SharedContext&lt;RepastHPCDemoAgent&gt;::LOCAL, countOfAgents, agents);

    <p>The code creates the iterator through the local agents and asks them to 'play'. It then re-sets the iterator to the beginning of the (same) list, and iterates through, asking the agents to 'move'. After the agents move, the code performs four tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calls the 'balance' method on the space. The balance method marks the agents that have moved into the buffer zones to be moved to the adjacent processes.</li>
        <li>Calls 'synchronizeAgentStatus', which performs the move; agents that had moved out of the local boundaries of one process are moved to the appropriate adjacent process.</li>
        <li>Calls 'synchronizeProjectionInfo', which will copy the agents within the local boundaries but inside some other process's buffer zone so that these agents are visible on the other processes.</li>
        <li>Calls 'synchronizeAgentStates', which performs a final update of all non-local agents so that they have the correct, current state of the local originals</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>IMPORTANT</b> This sequence of four calls (balance, synchronizeAgentStatus, synchronizeProjectionInfo, and synchronizeAgentState) is subtle. The 'balance' method must be called before the 'synchronizeAgentStatus' method; these two are usually called one after the other. But you may find it useful to call 'synchronizeProjectionInfo' in a different place- e.g., before the 'play' method is called. In this simulation, 'synchronizeAgentStates' probably doesn't need to be called after 'synchronizeProjectionInfo'; however, there are some instances where 'synchronizeProjectionInfo' does <b>not</b> result in all non-local agents having updated copies of their local originals' states. Generally this has to do with network projections, not spatial projections, so this is probably not a concern here. However, it is a good idea to keep in mind that the synchronize routines do not necessarily leave the simulation in a complete and consistent state; only by using all of them together are you <b>guaranteed</b> to leave the simulation in a consistent state.</p>
    <div class="sidebar" id="WhyNotConsistent" onClick=toggleSidebar("WhyNotConsistent")><b>Wait- why are multiple calls required? And isn't that inefficient?</b></div>
    <div class="defHIDDEN" id="WhyNotConsistent_DEF" onClick=toggleSidebar("WhyNotConsistent")>Having three calls to do different kinds of synchronization may seem like it's more burdensome; moreover, it may also seem inefficient. However, because of the way Repast HPC manages the synchronization steps, there really isn't a better way. The reason is that each step chops the local and non-local data up into different pieces and ships only what it needs to other processes. Merging the separate functions is actually impossible; the only way to do it is to chain them in a sequence. If, for example, we wanted to guarantee that 'synchronizeAgentStatuses' would leave the simulation in a perfectly coherent state, we would essentially have to add in the entire functions for synchronizeProjectionInfo and synchronizeAgentStates. It would be possible to wrap two or even all three functions into a single function, of course, but this wouldn't really save users very much effort. In practice, it is sometimes possible to know that <i>for a given simulation</i> one or more of the steps is unnecessary- and therefore having the functions callable as separate functions gives the user the opportunity to tune for specific contexts- but this is not true for the most general case.</div>
