== Problems

=== My project does not show up on Eclipse's run (launch) button
The project launch configuration has simply become hidden and needs to be manually
added to the list of available programs to run.  Follow these steps:
1. Choose "Organize Favorites" from the bottom of the Run menu 
2. Press the "Add" button on the upper left of the resulting "Organize Run Favorites" window. 
3. Select all of the items in the "Add Run Favorites" window.

=== WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
The following warning message occurs when using Java 9 or later, and has no impact
on the model code, performance, or reliability, and can be safely ignored:

----
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by ...
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of ...
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
----

=== SEVERE: Retrieval returned no content for \https://worldwind20.arc.nasa.gov/...
This is a benign warning that sometimes occurs in GIS displays because the online
server for layers like satellite imagery is unreachable or offline.  The only impact
of this error is that some GIS display imagery data may be unavailable.  Model behavior
is not affected.

=== WARN "Empty or non-existent path"
When launching a Repast model, the following errors may occur in the console:

----
WARN  ... Warning while parsing classpath: Empty or non-existent path 'mypath'.
WARN  ... While initializing watchers: Empty or non-existent path 'mypath'.
WARN  ....While initializing classpath: Empty or non-existent path 'mypath'.
----
indicating that the model classpath has not been configured, or is empty.  Check
that the *user_path.xml* agents entry points to the correct path for the model agents,
usually by default this is "../bin".  This warning will also occur if no agent
classes are defined within the "mypath" location.

=== When I run my model I see the error "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: somepackage.someclass at ..."
This is caused by a Java classpath configuration error such that the model cannot
find the specified class "somepackage.someclass".  If the specified class refers to
a user-created model file, please make sure that the *user_path.xml* agents path
is pointing to the project "../bin" folder.  If the specified class is not a user-defined
class, it is probably referenced from a third party library.  Make sure the library
is included in the project /lib folder and that the *user_path.xml* specifies the /lib
folder as a classpath entry.

=== I press the run button but nothing happens or the tick reads -1
The tick counter will not increment if no behaviors have been scheduled.  Schedule
agent behaviors in the agent classes using the @ScheduledMethod annotation.

=== Error "log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (MessageCenter.INTERNAL.repast.simphony.ui.RSUIPlugin)"
An issue sometimes occurs with the Repast message logging system that results in 
error messages like
----
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (MessageCenter.INTERNAL.repast.simphony.ui.RSApplication).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
----

with some variability in the (MessageCenter....) part. In almost all cases, this 
warning is NOT actually related to logging configuration errors, and more likely 
it is related to problems in the user_path.xml file like incorrect paths, or 
missing agent class files.

When you start a Repast model and you get the log4j message in the Eclipse console, 
you can usually find more information from the Repast runtime error log. 
The error log is available when the icon in the lower right corner of the Repast runtime is flashing.

=== Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
Java has attempted to use more memory that is available to the model.  With version
of Java prior to version 9, it was usually necessary to specify the amount of memory
needed by an application, because the default amount or "heap space" was very small.
Java 9 and later generally have better memory management, however it is still possible
to experience an OutOfMemoryError if a model uses an unusually large amount of memory.

To increase the amount of system memory available to Java, a "VM" argument may be
specified in the Eclipse launch configuration for the model as shown in <<vmargs_image>>.
To increase the available memory (up to the physical system limit) use the -Xmx 
argument and provide a numerical value for the memory using the 'M' or 'G' qualifier
to specify megabytes or gigabytes.  For example -Xmx4000M and -Xmx4G both specify 
a memory limit of 4 GB.

=== When I run the model I get the runtime error javax.media.opengl.GLException
When running a Repast model with displays an error similar to that shown below is 
seen and the displays do not show correctly in the Repast runtime GUI:
----
javax.media.opengl.GLException: WindowsWGLDrawableFactory - Could not initialize shared resources...
ERROR [AWT-EventQueue-0] 12:13:10,314 repast.simphony.visualizationOGL2D.DisplayOGL2D - Error initializing OGL 2D display. JOGL must be installed and computer must support open gl rendering
javax.media.opengl.GLException: Profile GL2 is not available on null, but: [GLProfile[GL2ES2/GL4.hw], GLProfile[GL4/GL4.hw], GLProfile[GL3/GL3.hw], GLProfile[GL4/GL4.hw], GLProfile[GL2GL3/GL4.hw]]
	at javax.media.opengl.GLProfile.get(GLProfile.java:806)
----
This is caused by the system's graphics card drivers being out of date, or the 
system graphics hardware not supporting OpenGL.  The most common cause of this error
is out of date graphics drivers.  The graphics drivers should be updated and are
generally available from the computer manufaturer or directly from the GPU support
sites of NVidia or ATI.
