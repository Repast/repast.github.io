== Programming with Repast Simphony

=== Where can I find example models?

A library of example Repast models is included with Repast.  Please see the 
Quick Start guide for instructions on using the example models.

=== Do I have to use Java or Groovy for my agents?
Repast Simphony accepts both user-defned POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) as well
as POGOs (Plain Old Groovy Objects) as agents (or for defning other model components),
making the use of Groovy completely optional. For those interested in learning more 
about Groovy, a dynamically typed programming language very well integrated with Java, there is the Groovy
home page http://groovy.codehaus.org/ and the very informative book "Groovy in
Action" by Dierk Koenig.

==== How do I schedule a "global" behavior, a behavior above the individual agent level?

There's at least two ways to do this. Both assume that you create your model in 
your own ContextBuilder Java class.

The first way requires that you have your ContextBuilder extend DefaultContext. 
Once you've done this you can add @ScheduledMethods to this ContextBuilder to 
perform some global action.

-----
public class MyContextBuilder extends DefaultContext implements ContextBuilder {
  /**
  * Builds and returns a context. Building a context consists of filling
  * it with agents, adding projects and so forth. The returned context
  * does not necessarily have to be the passed in context.
  *
  * @param context
  * @return the built context .
  */
  public Context build ( Context <T> context ) {
  ...
  }

  @ScheduledMethod ( start = 1)
  public void step () { 
    // my " global " behavior
  }
}
-----

The second way uses the RunEnvironment object to get a reference to the current 
Schedule with which can add your behavior. For example

-----
public class MyContextBuilder implements ContextBuilder {
  public Context build ( Context <T> context ) {

    ISchedule schedule = RunEnviroment.getCurrentSchedule ();
    ScheduleParameters params = ScheduleParameters.createOneTime(1);
    schedule.schedule(params, this, " step ");
  }
  
  public void step () {
    // my global behavior
  }
}

==== How do I create a custom display?
All simphony displays implement IDisplay. link:CustomDisplay.java[CustomDisplay.java] 
is an example that displays a panel with a simple label in it. Note that most of 
the methods are empty or return null. The important methods are render, update and 
getPanel(). When update is called the display should update its internal state to 
reflect the latest state of whatever its displaying. When render is called, the 
display should draw those updates. getPanel is called during initialization to 
put a panel into a display tab.

The next step then is to load this display during initialization. You do
that with a ModelInitializer. The model initializer is run once just after your scenario is
loaded. It can be used to add additional items to the scenario tree that's displayed on the
left hand side of the Repast runtime GUI. A model initializer then
can add a custom action that initializes a custom display. 
link:TrapInitializer.java[TrapInitializer.java] does just
that. The second added controller action is what sets up the custom display. Lastly, you
need tell Simphony to run your ModelInitializer and you do that in the scenario.xml file
located in your scenario directory (e.g. mousetrap.rs) by adding a model.initializer entry.

For example
----
model.initializer class="repast.simphony.demo.mousetrap.TrapInitializer"

==== Where can I find 3D models to use in displays?
There are many online sources for 3D model files that can be used in Repast 3D 
displays. The models available online generally are of one of the more popular formats such 
as Lightwave, Wavefront OBJ or AutoDesk 3DS. To display one of these models in a 
Repast 3D display, the file needs to be loaded as a 
https://download.java.net/media/java3d/javadoc/1.5.2-latest/com/sun/j3d/loaders/Loader.html[com.sun.j3d.loaders.Scene] 
object. The Scene object is then used to define the TaggedBranchGroup object that 
is provided by the user-defined 3D style class. 

The J3D group provides an interface com.sun.j3d.loaders.Loader which returns the 
Scene object provided the model file. The default J3D Loader implentations handle 
models of type Wavefront OBJ, and Lightwave files. We have additionally included 
a Loader implementation that handles MilkShape (.ms3d) files. 
Milkshape http://www.milkshape3d.com/ a shareware 3D modeling tool 
that has the ability to import and convert many different types of 3D model files. 
Generally, if a 3D model is available online it may be opened with Milkshape 
and saved in the MS3D format.

=== Running Models
==== How can I run Repast Simphony from another Java application?
Repast may be launched programmatically by directly calling the 
repast.simphony.runtime.RepastMain class. RepastMain takes two arguments, the 
first is the location of the model scenario directory and the second is an 
optional location of the repast runtime location.

Note that you need to have repast.simphony.runtime/bin and the jars in 
repast.simphony.runtime/lib on your classpath since the runtime needs these to start.

Also, you can put the repast runtime folders anywhere you like if you are calling 
the RepastMain from your own code. As long as you have repast.simphony.runtime/bin 
to your classpath, RepastMain will be able to find the runtime and start properly.

Here's a simple class that will do this:

-----
public class UserMain {

public UserMain(){};

  public void start(){

    String[] args = new String[]{"C:/myModel/scenario.rs"};

    repast.simphony.runtime.RepastMain.main(args);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    UserMain um = new UserMain();
    um.start();
  }
}
----

==== How can I control the Repast Simphony schedule from another Java application?
To run a simulation purely programmatically with fine control, you need to create 
a class that extends repast.simphony.engine.environment.AbstractRunner and modify 
it to suit your needs. The runner class can then be used to initialize, step, run, 
pause, stop and reset the model. This approach uses components from the GUI which 
is totally user driven and the Batch run which is completely self-contained with 
no user-interaction.

The example Java runner class link:TestRunner_2.java[TestRunner_2.java] and 
main class link:TestMain_2.java[TestMain_2.java] provide examples.  
In this case you won't use either the RepastMain (GUI) or the BatchMain (batch mode), 
but use the runner class directly. Note that you will need to include the classes 
from repast.simphony.runtime and repast.simphony.Batch in your classpath to run.

=== Model Configuration
==== How can I convert my Repast Simphony 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2 model to run in Repast Simphony 2.0 and later?
To upgrade scenarios simply do the following:

* Right click on the scenario folder (usually "yourmodelname.rs").
* Choose "Convert Scenario" from the popup menu.

This will create a *user\_path.xml* and a *context.xml* from your old Score file. 
It will also make backup copy of the scenario.xml file and then remove any displays 
from the scenario file. Removing the displays is necessary because old Piccolo 
2D displays will no longer load in version 2.0.

==== How can I convert my Repast J model to run in Repast Simphony?
A quick summary of the process of converting to Repast J to Repast S:

* Create a new Repast Simphony project or add the Repast nature to your existing project(see tutorial).
* Strip out all of the Repast J-specific visualization code from your agents (ie extends DefaultDrawableNode).
* Pick out the relative information such as scheduling and model parameters from the Repast J main class (ie SimpleModelImpl) and put this in the Repast S ContextBuilder or agent class constructors (where ever you see fit).
* Create a scenario/score model.
* Create displays, loggers, etc via the Repast S runtime interface.

Several of the demos (sugarscape and regression) included with Repast Simphony 
are direct ports from the Repast J models, so comparing these will provide some 
additional help on porting models.
