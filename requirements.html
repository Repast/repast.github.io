	Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms
	can be found in the <a href="https://repast.github.io/quick_start.html">Quick Start Guide</a>.
	Repast Simphony is a Java application and requires either Java 8 or Java 11 to be installed. If you
	do not have Java installed, the following options are suggested:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Windows users may choose to install the Java 11 Development Kit 
		(JDK) included with the Repast Simphony Windows installer.  This will install
		Java as a folder within the Repast installation location and will not 
		interfere with existing Java or Repast installations.</li>
		
		<li>macOS, linux, and Windows users may download a Java 11 or Java 8 JDK from 
		<a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">Adopt Open JDK</a>. Select either
		<i>OpenJDK 8 with Hotspot</i> or <i>OpenJDK 11 with Hotspot</i>. 
		<b>Note that if you need Repast 3D displays under macOS, then you must 
		choose Java 8.</b> <br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>macOS users</b> should Untar the downloaded file and copy the package to 
			<tt>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines</tt>.</li>
			
			<li><b>Windows users</b> should unzip the downloaded file and copy the folder
			to any convenient location.  The OpenJDK installers no longer set the
			system PATH or JAVA_HOME, so this needs to be done manually.

			This post on Stack Overflow</a> desribes how to configure OpenJDK for
			Windows.</li>
			
			<li><b>Linux users</b> may try the system package manager to download 
			and install an appropriate JDK.  This approach should work for Java 8,
			however many distributions still do not have JDK 11 available as an
			option via the online package repositories.  The OpenJDK 11 tarball can be
			extracted an manually installed on linux.  For example, the

	<h3 class="title">Why OpenJDK?</h3>
	<div class="entry">
	In the past users have typically downloaded a Java Development Kit (JDK) 
	distribution from Oracle and used it for free. These releases were built 
	with the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net">OpenJDK</a> source with some 
	non-essential proprietary extras added. However, with the release of Java 11, 
	Oracle's JDK is no longer free for commercial use. For this reason, we are 
	recommending users install an <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">Adopt Open JDK</a> 
	release built from OpenJDK source. Java 11 has been designated a long term 
	support (LTS) release and as such will continue to be supported by the OpenJDK 
	team with bug and security fixes for 4 years. The AdoptOpenJDK project provides 
	JDK binaries for all of the major platforms built from the OpenJDK source 
	using a robust build & test system.<br>

	<br>
	See <a href="https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/time-to-look-beyond-oracles-jdk.html">here</a> for
	additional information on Oracle and OpenJDK.
