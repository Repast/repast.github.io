Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms
can be found in the <a href="https://repast.github.io/quick_start.html">Quick Start Guide</a>.
Repast Simphony is a Java application and requires either Java 8 or Java 11 to be installed. <b>Note
that if you need 3D visualizations under macOS, then you must choose Java 8.</b> If you do not have
one of these installed, either one
can be downloaded from <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">Adopt Open JDK</a>. Select either
<i>OpenJDK 8 with Hotspot</i> or <i>OpenJDK 11 with Hotspot</i>.

  <h3>Why OpenJDK?</h3>
<br>
In the past users have typically downloaded a Java Development Kit (JDK) distribution from
Oracle and used it for free. These releases were built with the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net">OpenJDK</a>
source with some non-essential proprietary extras added. However, with the release of Java 11, Oracle's
JDK is no longer free for commerical use. For this reason, we are recommending users install an
AdoptOpenJDK release built from OpenJDK source. Java 11 has been designated a long term support (LTS)
release and as such will continue to be supported by the OpenJDK team with bug and security fixes for
4 years. The AdoptOpenJDK project provides JDK
binaries for all of the major platforms built from the OpenJDK source using a robust build & test
system.

See <a href="https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/time-to-look-beyond-oracles-jdk.html">here</a> for
additional information on Oracle and OpenJDK.
