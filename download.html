<h1 class="title">Which Repast Edition Should You Download and Use?</h1>
<p class="meta"></p>
<div class="entry">
There are two editions of Repast and several ways to write models in each edition because there are many different kinds of users,
each of whom has unique needs:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>New users are strongly encouraged to begin by using ReLogo within Repast Simphony.</b>
<!--
<li><b>Users with existing Repast models should use Repast Simphony and follow the <a href="./docs/RepastFAQ.pdf"><i>FAQ</i></a> sections on upgrading models.</b>
-->
<li>Users with limited programming backgrounds are strongly encouraged to use ReLogo within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users desiring rapid prototyping are encouraged to use ReLogo within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users seeking visual model construction are encouraged to use ReLogo and Statecharts within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users with a workable knowledge of a Java-generating language such as Groovy and who want to use the features of that language should to use their chosen language along with the Java approach within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users with a workable knowledge of Java who want highly customized models should to use the Java approach within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users with a basic knowledge of C++ who <i><b>need models that run on supercomputers</i></b> should use the Logo-style C++ approach within Repast HPC.
<li>Users with a strong knowledge of C++ who <i><b>need highly customized models that run on supercomputers</i></b> should to use the standard C++ approach within Repast HPC.
</ul>
Tutorials on each of these approaches are included in the Repast downloads available below and <a href="docs.html">here</a>.

<h1 class="title">Newest Repast Simphony Release</h1>
<p class="meta"></p>
<div class="entry">
Everything you need for ReLogo, flowchart, Groovy, and Java-based development is included in the following Repast Simphony {{ site.simphony_version }} downloads
released on {{ site.simphony_release_date }}:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Windows users</b> should download the either the
<a href="https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony/releases/download/v2.4.0/Repast-Simphony-2.4-win32.exe">Windows 32-bit Installer</a> or
the <a href="https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony/releases/download/v2.4.0/Repast-Simphony-2.4-win64.exe">Windows 64-bit Installer</a>.
Double click
on the resulting executable installer file, follow the installation wizard's prompts, and then complete the <a href="docs.html">chosen tutorial</a>.

<li><b>Mac OS X users</b> should download the
<a href="https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony/releases/download/v2.4.0/Repast.Simphony.2.4.0.dmg">Mac OS X Disk Image</a>,
double click on the resulting file, follow the installation instructions that
appear, and then complete the <a href="docs.html">chosen tutorial</a>. Note that you may You may need to alter your Security & Privacy
settings in System Preferences to allow you to open Repast Simphony. Alternatively, right clicking on the Repast Simphony
application and selecting Open will allow you to authenticate and open it.

<li><b>Linux users</b> and <b>Unix-related system users</b> should download
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-eclipse-committers/neon1">Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers Neon 1</a>; then use
the Eclipse Update Manager (under Help -> Install New Software) to install Repast from its update
site (<a href="https://repocafe.cels.anl.gov/repos/repast/">https://repocafe.cels.anl.gov/repos/repast/</a>).
Repast when installed via the update site has the following additional requirement that can be installed
using Eclipse's Update Manager.
<ul>
<li>From the Groovy Update Site (http://dist.springsource.org/snapshot/GRECLIPSE/e4.6/):
<ul>
<li>Extra Groovy Compilers</li>
<li>Groovy-Eclipse</li>
<li>Uncategorized</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Once you have downloaded eclipse and installed the plugins, the groovy compiler version must be set to anything in the 2.0. version line. Anything else
will prevent Repast Simphony and especially ReLogo from working correctly. You can set the groovy compiler preferences in either the workspace or project preferences
pane via the "Groovy Compiler" page.<p><p>

The demonstration models are not provided via the update site, but they can be downloaded
<a href="https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony.models/archive/v2.4.0.zip">here</a>.
Once downloaded, start eclipse and switch to your chosen workspace. Right click in the package panel, and choose import, General, Archive File
and follow the wizard from there.
</ul>
An Eclipse update site is also available. Interested users should follow the installation instructions given above for the Linux release.
<br><br>A few important notes are as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Examples can be imported from the Repast Models library as described in the <a href="./docs/RepastSimphonyFAQ.pdf">Repast FAQ</a>.
<li>Information on installing optional external analysis tools can be found <a href="download-extras.html">here</a>.
<li>A solution to issues with some NVIDIA graphics drivers is described in the <a href="./docs/RepastSimphonyFAQ.pdf">Repast FAQ</a>.
