<h1 class="title">Which Repast Edition Should You Download?</h1>
<p class="meta"></p>
<div class="entry">
There are two editions of Repast and several ways to write models in each edition because there are many different kinds of users,
each of whom has unique needs:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>New users are strongly encouraged to begin by using ReLogo within Repast Simphony.</b>
<!--
<li><b>Users with existing Repast models should use Repast Simphony and follow the <a href="./docs/RepastFAQ.pdf"><i>FAQ</i></a> sections on upgrading models.</b>
-->
<li>Users with limited programming backgrounds are strongly encouraged to use ReLogo within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users desiring rapid prototyping are encouraged to use ReLogo within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users seeking visual model construction are encouraged to use ReLogo and Statecharts within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users with a workable knowledge of a Java-generating language such as Groovy and who want to use the features of that language should to use their chosen language along with the Java approach within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users with a workable knowledge of Java who want highly customized models should to use the Java approach within Repast Simphony.
<li>Users with a basic knowledge of C++ who <i><b>need models that run on supercomputers</i></b> should use the Logo-style C++ approach within Repast HPC.
<li>Users with a strong knowledge of C++ who <i><b>need highly customized models that run on supercomputers</i></b> should to use the standard C++ approach within Repast HPC.
</ul>
Tutorials on each of these approaches are included in the Repast downloads available below and <a href="docs.html">here</a>.

<li><b>Linux users</b> and <b>Unix-related system users</b> should download
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-eclipse-committers/oxygen1a">
Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers Oxygen 1a</a>; then use the Eclipse Update
Manager (under Help -> Install New Software) to install Repast and required dependencies
from their respective update sites.
<ol>
	<li>Repast requires some update site components that are not available on the Oxygen
	update site.  Please first add the Neon update site to the list of available Eclipse
	update sites.  This is done by simply adding Neon in the Eclipse "Install New Software"
	wizard:
		<ul>
			<li><b>http://download.eclipse.org/releases/neon</b></li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Install Groovy Eclipse from the update site:
		<ul>
			<li><b>http://dist.springsource.org/snapshot/GRECLIPSE/e4.7</b></li>
			<li>Extra Groovy Compilers</li>
			<li>Groovy-Eclipse</li>
			<li>Uncategorized</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Install Repast from the update site:
		<ul>
			<li><b>https://repocafe.cels.anl.gov/repos/repast</b></li>
		</ul>
	</li>

</ol>


Once you have downloaded eclipse and installed the plugins, the groovy compiler version must be set to anything in the 2.0. version line. Anything else
will prevent Repast Simphony and especially ReLogo from working correctly. You can set the groovy compiler preferences in either the workspace or project preferences
pane via the "Groovy Compiler" page.<p><p>

The demonstration models are not provided via the update site, but they can be downloaded
<a href="https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony.models/archive/v.2.5.zip">here</a>.
Once downloaded, start eclipse and switch to your chosen workspace. Right click in the package panel, choose Import, 
General, Projects From Folder or Archive, and follow the wizard from there. Note that you may have to "clean" the projects once they have been imported to remove any errors. To clean the projects, select Project from the menu bar, and then Clean and click the Clean button.
</ul>
An Eclipse update site is also available. Interested users should follow the installation instructions given above for the Linux release.
<br><br>A few important notes are as follows:
<p>
<ul>
